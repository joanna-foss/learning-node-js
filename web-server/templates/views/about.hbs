        <h4>Hello!</h4>
        <p>My name is Joanna, and I created this application.</p>
        <p>Simply Weather was created using Node JS, Express, and a couple of APIs. Specifically, the mapbox API and the weatherstack API were used in this project to produce the data you see dynamically displayed on the home page.</p>
