# learning-node-js

In this repository I'll be exploring nodejs.

Here, I'll create the following:
- note building application
- weather application using APIs
  <br><a href='https://foss-weather-application.herokuapp.com/'>View my weather app here!</a>
- task manager REST API
- chat application with client-side companion

This is done using the The Complete Node.js Developer Course on Udemy.
